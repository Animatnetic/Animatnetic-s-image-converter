Hello!!! Thank you for downloading my application!
It is simple but I am a beginner programmer. This programme is open source, you can use it to your heart's content!
Make sure, whenever you downloaded this exe file that it is in a folder of your choice as the images you have converted will end up there along with wherever
your exe file is. For example, if you left it at download's directory, all the images will go there and it will become a big
mess. So instead I reccomend to put it in a folder somewhere in another area like the Pictures library or whatever u want. 

Also, an extra thing to add, your image name will be changed to "conver_result.[image file type]"

Keep in mind, if you want to convert png into jpeg and your png image has file transparency, nothing will jappen as jpeg can not support image transparecy.
